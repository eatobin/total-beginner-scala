create in projects folder with command:

activator new total-beginner-scala minimal-scala

then replace:

// Change this to another test framework if you prefer
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.2.4" % "test"
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.scala-lang" % "scala-reflect" % "2.11.7",
  "org.scala-lang.modules" % "scala-xml_2.11" % "1.0.4"
)

...to remove version conflict warnings

then import project to idea as SBT project

scalaVersion := "2.11.7"

// Change this to another test framework if you prefer
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.2.4" % "test"
