# total-beginner-scala

I always write this simple project in any new language I'm learning. I started in Java and proceeded to Ruby, Clojure, Haskell and Scala. I'm currently working on an Elixir version! I try to be language-idiomatic in each. Also functional where possible - since that appeals to my brain...

It began with [Eclipse and Java for Total Beginners](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/totalbeginner.html).
